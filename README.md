Create a Product base class that contains fields for the product name, price, and quantity in stock.
Next, create subclasses for different product types, e.g.
"Electronics", "Clothing", "food", etc., which inherit the "Product" class.
In each of these subclasses, override the "buy" method, which decrements the item in stock after the purchase.
Create a "Cart" class that contains a list of products and an "add" method that allows you to add products to the cart. 
Write the code that creates an object of class "Basket", 
adds several different products to the cart, performs purchase and updates the number of goods in stock.
